/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/Bio/Application/__init__.py:40: BiopythonDeprecationWarning: The Bio.Application modules and modules relying on it have been deprecated.

Due to the on going maintenance burden of keeping command line application
wrappers up to date, we have decided to deprecate and eventually remove these
modules.

We instead now recommend building your command line and invoking it directly
with the subprocess module.
